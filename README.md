### Files

In the repository there are available the following files:

**run_analysis.R**: an R script that performs the five steps asked in the description of the assignment:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**Tidy_Dataset.txt**: a file with the dataset obtained after running the run_analysis.R script.

**CodeBook.md**: a code book that explains the transformations applied to the original dataset through the run_analysis.R script to obtain the dataset as presented in the Tidy_Dataset.txt file. It also includes an explanation of the variables within the dataset mentioned above.
